# Learning fundamentals of Angular
My journey with Angular. 
## MVC
 *Model − It is the lowest level of the pattern responsible for maintaining data.

 *View − It is responsible for displaying all or a portion of the data to the user.

 *Controller − It is a software Code that controls the interactions between the Model and View.

## Directives
*AngularJS directives are used to extend HTML.

## Expressions

*Expressions are used to bind application data to html. 
*Expressions are written inside double braces like {{ expression}}. 
*Expressions behaves in same way as ng-bind directives. 
**AngularJS application expressions are pure javascript expressions and outputs the data where they are used.
```
Give examples
```

## Controllers
* AngularJS application mainly relies on controllers to control the flow of data in the application. 
* A controller is defined using ng-controller directive.
* A controller is a JavaScript object containing attributes/properties and functions.
*Each controller accepts $scope as a parameter which refers to the application/module that controller is to control.
```
<div ng-app = "" ng-controller = "studentController">
   ...
</div>
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
